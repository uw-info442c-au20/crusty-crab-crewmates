Seattle, University District	PET	1		13	Polyethylene Terephthalate	Soft drinks,water,ketchup,and beer bottles,mouthwash bottles,peanut butter containers,salad dressing and vegetable oil containers	Can you recycle this? Yes!	PET or PETE can be picked up through most curbside recycling programs as long as it's been emptied and rinsed of any food. When it comes to caps, our environmental pros say itâ€™s probably better to dispose of them in the trash (since they're usually made of a different type of plastic), unless your town explicitly says you can throw them in the recycle bin. There's no need to remove bottle labels because the recycling process separates them.
Seattle, Capital Hill	HDPE	2		29	High Density Polyethylene	Milk jugs,juice bottles,bleach,detergent,and other household cleaner bottles,shampoo bottles,some trash and shopping bags;motor oil bottles;butter and yogurt tubs,cereal box liners	Can you recycle this? Yes!	HDPE can often be picked up through most curbside recycling programs, although some allow only containers with necks. Flimsy plastics (like grocery bags and plastic wrap) usually can't be recycled, but some stores will collect and recycle them.
Seattle, Ballard	PVC	3		42	Polyvinyl Chloride	Shampoo and cooking oil bottles,blister packaging,wire jacketing,siding,windows, piping	Can you recycle this? No.	PVC and V can rarely be recycled, but it's accepted by some plastic lumber makers. If you need to dispose of either material, ask your local waste management to see if you should put it in the trash or drop it off at a collection center.
Seattle, Fremont	LDPE	4		52	Low Density Polyethylene	Squeezable bottles,bread,frozen food,dry cleaning,and shopping bags,tote bags,furniture	Can you recycle this? Yes!	LDPE is not often recycled through curbside programs, but some communities might accept it. That means anything made with LDPE (like toothpaste tubes) can be thrown in the trash. Just like we mentioned under HDPE, plastic shopping bags can often be returned to stores for recycling.
	PP	5		65	Polypropylene	Some yogurt containers,syrup and medicine bottles,caps,straws	Can you recycle this? Yes	PP can be recycled through some curbside programs, just don't forget to make sure there's no food left inside. It's best to throw loose caps into the garbage since they easily slip through screens during recycling and end up as trash anyways.
	PS	6		76	Polystyrene	Disposable plates and cups,meat trays,egg cartons,carry-out containers,aspirin bottles,compact disc cases	Can you recycle this? Usually not.	Not many curbside recycling programs accept PS in the form of rigid plastics (and many manufacturers have switched to using PET instead). Since foam products tend to break apart into smaller pieces, you should place them in a bag, squeeze out the air, and tie it up before putting it in the trash to prevent pellets from dispersing.
	Misc.	7		95	Miscellanious	Three-and five-gallon water bottles,bullet-proof materials,sunglasses,DVDs,iPod and computer cases,signs and displays,certain food containers,nylon	Can you recycle this? Usually not.	Unfortunately, these plastics are not commonly recycled.
