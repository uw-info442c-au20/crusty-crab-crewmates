# User Personas
We have three different stakeholders that will be affected or can be involved with our idea.



#### Good Intentioned, Poorly Informed
Meet Gary, a 24 year old adult that's also an average recycler. He is pretty sure that he knows the basic of recycling from what he's been taught by his parents and K-12 schools.

A common scenario that happens to him when it comes to recycling is when he is unsure if a certain item is recyclable.
In the end, he throws the item in the recycling bin because he thinks that the workers will fix any of his mistakes.

"Isn't it more harmful if I put the item in the landfill if it is recyclable?"

Gary encompasses aspirational recycling. He has good intentions but, in reality, he's causing more harm.

Gary needs to know that what he's doing is wrong and needs to be educated with his local recycling rules.

#### Ambivalent, Poorly Informed
Next up is Sandy. Sandy grew up in a small rural town that did not have any recycling facility. Therefore, she did not grow up recycling nor learned how to.

Eventually, Sandy moved to the Seattle area where recycling is common and appreciated. However, Sandy doesn't really understand recycling and decides not to do practice it.

Sandy needs to have an easy and encouraging way to learn about recycling and how it can be beneficial.

#### Worker on the Recycling Floor
Larry is a recyclables operation manager that mainly supervises the transportation and processing of regular waste and recyclables.

Larry considers himself as a pro when it comes to sorting trash because he's been formally taught what can be processed and sorted due to the nature of his job.

Larry knows that at his facility, there are no workers to personally sort out wrong materials sorted as recyclable. Whenever he sees a mistake, he throws away the entire bin of recyclables in fear of contamination.

Larry knows that people need to be informed on what is acceptable to throw away but he doesn't know how to do so besides telling his friends and family in person.
